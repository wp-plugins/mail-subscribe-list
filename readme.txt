This plugin allows users to enter their name and email address to subscribe to a list which is available to view and export in the wordpress admin.

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to enter their name and email address on a simple unstyled form to subscribe to a simple mailing list which is available to view and modify in the wordpress admin area. 

The subscribe form can be displayed on any wordpress page using the shortcode [smlsubform] or from your wordpress theme by calling the php function <?php echo smlsubform(); ?>.

I developed this plugin as I could not find any plugin that simply allows users to submit their name and email address to a simple list viewable in the wordpress admin, all the plugins that I found had lots of extra features such as sending out mass emails and double opt-in which my clients do not need.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mail-subscribe-list` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[smlsubform]` in any of your pages or <?php echo smlsubform(); ?> in your templates
